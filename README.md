# RL-algorithms

This repository is for testing and visualizing multiple RL algorithms over different environments

## Q-learning
There are multiple environments for testing table Q-Learning like (Taxi-v2, MountainCar-v0, and CartPole-v0) environments.
* Taxi-v2: Using table to represent the Q value for each pair (state, action) "The number of pairs (state, action) is limited (500 states, 6 actions)".
* MountainCar-v0: Using a Wrapper for the environment it is possible to change the observations from continuous to discrete (limited number) by rounding them to a specific precision. Then it is possible to use Q-learning to teach an agent to climp the mountain.
* CartPole-v0: As in MountainCar it is possible to get discrete observations and Use standart Q-learning to teach an agent to balance the pole.
